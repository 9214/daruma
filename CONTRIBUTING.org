* Making daruma better
If you're, as a newbie, looking for a chance to prove oneself -- here it is! 

Start working with any of the issues I've left in this repo and hone your skills. Some of them are pretty trivial, most of them are fairly interesting. 
Also, bug squashing. It's not a Starship Trooper's poligon, but we consider bugs to be bad too.

I believe that it's a good opportunity for both of us to learn how to communicate is OSS world and make collaborative stuff together in an informal and relaxed way. So, just keep fun in a house.

*A few prerequisites though:*
- stick with the original coding style and format everything accordingly (one exception is /dialects/ or when clarity should be over clutter);
- test that everything works;
- then test it again;
- leave some comment breadcrumbs on your gotchas and non-trivial coding somersaults;
- be nice.
